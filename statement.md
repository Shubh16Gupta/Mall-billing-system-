#  Mall Billing & Inventory Management System  
**A Super Simple Python Project That Actually Feels Useful!**  



---

### The Problem We All Face in Stores  
Imagine you're running a shop (or even a small mall store). Right now, most people still do things the old-school way:  

- Writing stock in a notebook  
- Calculating bills by hand (and making mistakes!)  
- Forgetting when something is about to finish  
- Customers waiting forever to know the price or where an item is kept  

It’s slow, stressful, and honestly… kind of **chaotic**

### So Here’s What I Built!  
A **super simple, text-based (console) system in Python** that makes running a store **1000x easier and faster**!  

No fancy graphics • No internet needed • Just pure Python magic that works offline and saves everything automatically.

### Owner Side (The Boss Mode) 

These are the cool things the shop owner can do:

1. **Add New Products**  
   Just type name, price, quantity, discount (%), and aisle number → saved forever!

2. **Restock Items**  
   Got new stock? Just say how many pieces came in — done!

3. **See Full Product List**  
   Everything neatly shown: name, price, stock left, discount, location.

4. **Low Stock Alert!**  
   If any item has **≤5 pieces left** → big warning: “Hey! Restock this soon!”

5. **Activity Log**  
   Every change is recorded with date & time  
   (e.g., “Added 20 Sooji on 23-Nov-2025 at 2:30 PM”)

### Customer Side (Shopping Made Easy) 

When a customer comes:

1. **Generate Bill**  
   Pick items → enter quantity → boom! Total with discount auto-applied. Looks professional!

2. **Check Price Instantly**  
   “Bhaiya, yeh Sooji kitne ka hai?” → Type name → price pops up in a second.

3. **Find Where It’s Kept**  
   “It’s in Aisle 5, near the mirror!” → No more running around confused.

### Tech Stuff (The Magic Behind It)

- Everything saved in a simple `products.txt` file (no database needed!)  
- Clean menu that even your uncle can use  
- Smart error handling — type anything wrong? No crash! It’ll politely ask again.  
- 100% beginner-friendly code with tons of comments

### What I Didn’t Add (On Purpose!)  
Kept it simple so anyone can understand and run it:

-  No GUI (no Tkinter or heavy stuff)  
-  No login system  
-  No barcode scanner  
-  No internet/cloud  

Just **pure Python power**!
